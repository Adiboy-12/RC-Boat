# 🚤 Arduino-Based RC Boat with Custom Wireless Transmitter & Receiver

This project is a fully functional **RC Boat** built from scratch using **Arduino**, **nRF24L01 wireless modules**, a **brushed ESC**, **brushless BLDC motor**, and a **servo for steering**.  
Both the **transmitter** and **receiver** were designed and programmed manually — no off-the-shelf RC modules were used.

The aim of the project was to understand **wireless communication**, **motor control**, and **real-world dynamics** while building a stable and responsive RC system.
